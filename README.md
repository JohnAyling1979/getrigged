# getrigged
A website made few years back by me and my friends.

Disclaimer: I am sorry for the headache this project is going to give you, if you decide to make a PR, maily due to bad code quality of this project (we had just learned PHP)

This repo is open for PRs.

List of things needed to be done:
1. Arrange files in folders.
2. Delete unnecessary files.
3. Refactor code for anti patterns and bad practices (this is going to take a while).
4. Test application
